# Etch-a-sketch

1. Patience, lots of it.
2. Awuful commits.
3. Messy code.
4. Couldn't implement the border on a canvas since it would mess up the layout, so I just changed the colors of body and container. (yep)
5. Creating the grid was the hardest part of all. I've actually completed all the tasks before doing it (aside from darkening). I'm not sure I remember how it's done.
6. Lot's of painful fun.
